			<h2>Scrolled Flow</h2>
			<p>Tests whether setting the global <code>rendition:flow</code> property to <code>scrolled-doc</code> results in
				scrollable documents. The test passes if each of the documents in this publication is vertically scrollable, and swiping horizontally moves from one to
				the next.</p>
			<p>
				<em>
					Note: Some reading systems allow readers to manually change the flow (e.g., from dynamically
						paginated to scrolled). Do <strong>not</strong> use these settings for this test. To pass, the reading system must adapt to the specified flow.
