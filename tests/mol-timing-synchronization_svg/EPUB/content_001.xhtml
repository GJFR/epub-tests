        <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System implements Media Overlays on SVG content with associated styling) if</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
            <li>If turned on, the extract on the next (SVG) page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
            <li>If the Reading System implements the association with style information, the text being read is highlighted with a green background and the rest of the text is grayed out</li>
        </ol>
