    <p style="margin: 1em; -epub-word-break: keep-all;">The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it.</p>

    <p style="margin: 1em; -epub-word-break: break-all;">In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentlemanâ€™s days were comfortably spent.
