			<h2>Continuously-Scrolled Flow</h2>
			<p>Tests whether setting the global <code>rendition:flow</code> property to <code>scrolled-continuous</code> results in
				a continuously scrolling interface. The test passes if the content of this publication is presented as one continuous scrolling document (as opposed to be dynamically paginated).</p>
			<p><em>Note: Some reading systems allow readers to manually change from the flow (e.g., from dynamically
					paginated to scrolled). Do <strong>not</strong> use these settings for this test. To pass, the reading system must adapt to the specified flow.
