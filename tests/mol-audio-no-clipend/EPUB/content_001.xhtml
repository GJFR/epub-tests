    <title>Rendering of an audio track until the end if clipEnd is missing</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System correctly handles the lack of a <code>clipEnd</code> attribute value) if</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
        <li>If turned on, the extract on the next page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
        <li>The full text is read</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The Reading System may highlight the text being read with a green background with the text grayed out;
        but this feature is not required for the test to pass. Note that, if highlighted,
        the highlight may get out of sync with after the second sentence: the audio keeps playing while the highlight remains on the second sentence. This is a possible effect of the missing <code>clipEnd</code> for the second sentence.
