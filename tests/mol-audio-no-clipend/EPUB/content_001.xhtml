    <title>Rendering of an audio track until the end if clipEnd is missing</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System correctly handles the lack of a <code>clipEnd</code> attribute value) if</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
        <li>If turned on, the extract on the next page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
        <li>The full text is read</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The Reading System may highlight the text being read with a green background with the text grayed out;
        but this feature is not required for the test to pass. Note that, if highlighted,
        the highlighting will stop at the third sentence while the audio keeps playing to the end of the paragraph. This is the effect of missing a <code>clipEnd</code> on the corresponding <code>par</code> element in the media overlay file.
