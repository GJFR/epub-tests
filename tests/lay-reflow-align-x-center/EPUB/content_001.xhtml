    <h1>rendition:align-x-center in reflowable documents</h1>

    <p>This test passes if the following page appears centered in the viewport.</p>

    <p>This test is not applicable to reading systems that do not support <code>rendition:align-x-center</code>. if this reading system does not support the property, mark it as "null".</p>

    <p>NOTE: This test may be hard to validate on reading systems offering only single-column views or portrait-only display. If the reading system does offer multiple column view or multiple orientations, ensure both settings are set to a default setting.</p>
