    <title>MO playback switching XHTML content</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Test passes (i.e., the Reading System supports playback of two consecutive XHTML Media documents, using a common MO file) if</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The next page is properly displayed as an XHTML content</li>
        <li>The Reading System provides the user with a way to turn text reading on</li>
        <li>If turned on, the extract on the next page is read aloud by the Reading System</li>
        <li>After the full paragraph is read, the content automatically switches to the next portion of the texts with two more paragraphs, 
            while read aloud continues without interruption.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Reading System may highlight the text being read with a green background with the text grayed out;
        but this feature is not required for the test to pass.</p>
